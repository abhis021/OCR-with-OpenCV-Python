# OCR Example with OpenCV, Python and Tesseract

<p>Here in this example we have, installed Tesseract from [here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) and after that we have just used its installation path inside the program.

Other than these you might need to install opencv-python and pytesseract packages in your venv. 

Just for the reference though, I have also put the requirements.txt file.


This is completely open source.</p>
